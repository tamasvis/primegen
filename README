Auxiliary files to error-inject specific non-primes into RSA key generation
(primality filtering)


Pregenerated pseudoprimes for cryptographically relevant prime
bitcounts are organized as:

carmichael.txt    -- Carmichael numbers, which pass the Fermat primality test
                  -- (main file)
carmichael2.txt   -- archived additional examples

mrabin.txt        -- pseudoprimes not detected as composites by Miller-Rabin,
                     with the first several primes as bases (main file)
mrabin2.txt       -- archived additional examples

mrworstcase.txt   -- worst-case inputs to Miller-Rabin: semiprimes of
                  -- the form (2x+1)*(4x+1) which get accepted with 1/4
                  -- probability by random Miller-Rabin witnesses.

ym1divexpn.txt    -- probable primes which would pass FIPS 186-4/5 primality
                  -- tests, but must be rejected since E=0x10001|P-1
                  -- (would be RSA-invalid with public exponent E)
