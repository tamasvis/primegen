Auxiliary files to error-inject specific non-primes into RSA key generation
(primality filtering)

Our pregenerated pseudoprimes for cryptographically relevant prime
bitcounts are organized as:

carmichael.txt    -- Carmichael numbers, which pass the Fermat primality test
                  -- (main file)
carmichael2.txt   -- archived additional examples

mrabin.txt        -- pseudoprimes to the first primes as bases (main file)
mrabin2.txt       -- archived additional examples

ym1divexpn.txt    -- probable primes which would pass FIPS 186-4/5 primality
                  -- tests, but must be rejected since E=0x10001|P-1
                  -- (which would be RSA-invalid)
